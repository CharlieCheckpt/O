# Disease prediction from DNA data

The goal of this project is to predict whether a given individual will have a specific disease or not, starting from the sequence of bases in the genome of this individual.

**Models**
I used several models for this binary classification challenge : 
* ElasticNet
* Xgboost
* Lightgbm
* Catboost
